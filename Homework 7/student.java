/*
for this problem you need to:
1. create 5 different students in your main
2. create a method in this file that returns if they're an honor roll student or not (gpa > 3.6) then
check each of the students in main
3. create a method to see if they get "free lunch" (this is a weird school, every day they generate a random student id
and see if any students match that id, if they do they get free lunch that day, yay!) compare a randomly generated id and the
id of the student to print the appropriate response.
